# Recursive Trait Inheritance System (RTIS)

## Overview

Recursive Trait Inheritance System (RTIS) is a conceptual artificial life and evolutionary system framework.

It defines a form of digital organism where **traits are the fundamental unit of inheritance**, not predefined body parts, templates, or hierarchical structures.

This repository serves as a **formal conceptual claim and timestamped definition** of the RTIS framework.

No implementation is provided.

## Core Concept

RTIS is based on the following principles:

- Traits are atomic, inheritable entities.
- Any trait can attach to any other trait.
- Traits themselves may act as hosts for further traits.
- There is no fixed body hierarchy, anatomical correctness, or predefined structure.
- Organism form is a temporary manifestation of a recursive trait network.

In this system:

- A head may grow from a hand.
- A hand may grow from a head.
- A head growing from a hand may itself grow another hand.
- Trait recursion depth is theoretically unbounded.

## Trait-Based Structure

RTIS rejects slot-based or part-based character construction.

Instead, each organism is represented as a **Trait Graph**:

- **Nodes:** Traits (e.g. head, hand, eye, color pattern, material, emission)
- **Edges:** Attachment or inheritance relationships

There is no mandatory root node.
Any trait may serve as an attachment point.

## Inheritance and Evolution

Organisms reproduce through processes such as:

- Mating (trait overlap reinforcement)
- Fusion (trait diffusion)
- Selective preference (aesthetic or intentional selection)

Trait inheritance probability is influenced by:

- Trait frequency in parent organisms
- Historical co-occurrence between traits
- Player-driven selection bias
- Environmental or contextual pressure

There is no concept of a final or correct form.

Only locally stable evolutionary states exist.

## Visual and Material Traits

Color, material, texture, pattern, and visual properties are treated as traits.

- No color limitation
- No material limitation
- No aesthetic constraints
- Visual traits may attach to any other trait
- Visual traits may stack, mutate, and recursively propagate

---

## Philosophical Position

RTIS does not define life by anatomical correctness.

Form is not a structure — it is a relationship.

Evolution is not progression toward completion,
but continuous directional drift.

---

## Intended Applications

RTIS is not limited to games.

Potential applications include:

- Artificial life simulations
- Experimental or generative games
- Interactive digital art systems
- Worldbuilding frameworks
- Speculative design research
- Conceptual IP development
